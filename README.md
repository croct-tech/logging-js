## Installation

We recommend using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) to install the package:

```sh
npm install @croct/logging
```

## Basic usage

The following example shows how to log a message using the [`ConsoleLogger`](src/consoleLogger.ts):

```ts
import {ConsoleLogger, LogLevel} from '@croct/logging';

const logger = new ConsoleLogger();

logger.log({
    level: LogLevel.ERROR,
    message: 'Unable to load data',
    details: { 
        cause: 'The request failed',
        status: 500,
    },
});
```

## Implementations

This package provides the following implementations:

- [SuppressedLogger](src/suppressedLogger.ts)  
  A logger that does not log anything, but can be used to suppress logging where desired.
- [ConsoleLogger](src/consoleLogger.ts)  
  A logger that writes to the console using the appropriate console API semantics.
- [PrefixedLogger](src/prefixedLogger.ts)  
  A logger that prepends a prefix to all log messages.

## Utilities

Because JavaScript allows throwing pretty much anything, proving more information about the error 
often requires a lot of boilerplate. 

This package provides a few utilities to make it easier to log errors:

- [extractErrorMessage](src/utilities.ts)  
  Extracts the error message from an unknown caught error.
- [formatErrorMessage](src/utilities.ts)  
  Formats an error message for use as the main message, falling back to a default message when 
  no message is available.
- [formatErrorCause](src/utilities.ts)
  formats an error message for use as a complement to the main message, falling back to a 
  default message when no message is available.
